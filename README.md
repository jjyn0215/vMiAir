Creating Virtual Air Purifier for SmartThings Edge

Massive Thank you to [@tooddaustin07](https://github.com/toddaustin07) for sharing drivers

## Why did you make this?
As you know, Mi home does not support SmartThings via cloud.

So my plan is send the data to ST hub through [node-red](https://github.com/stason325/node-red-contrib-miio-localdevices) server.
